Unity Google Cardboard VR Application

A classmate and I decided to work on creating a virtualy reality application for androids and iphones. I will be posting my Javascript here that I create, along with a short screenshot video to demonstrate the script in Unity. Our goal is to create many simple scripts with the Google Cardboard magnet input we are given. We will be using the prefabs CardboardMain for headset motion tracking and CardboardReticle for crosshairs/gameObject selection.

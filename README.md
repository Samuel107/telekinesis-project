# Telekinesis-Project
Unity Google Cardboard VR Application

A classmate and I decided to work on creating a virtualy reality application for androids and iphones. I will be posting my Javascript here that I create, along with a short screenshot video to demonstrate the script in Unity. Our goal is to create many simple scripts with the Google Cardboard magnet input we are given. We will be using the prefabs CardboardMain for headset motion tracking and CardboardReticle for crosshairs/gameObject selection.

## Project Layout


#### Software Using: 
	Unity3D 5.3.1, 3D Modeling Program (Blender, 3ds max, etc)

#### Title of Project: 
Nutmeg (Working Title)
Telekinesis something maybe?

#### Theme of Room:
Dome/Outdoors Area 

#### Controls / Inputs :
	
Google Cardboard: Manipulating objects with button on headset.

Movement: Hold down move with button or point and travel style

Head Tracking Headset (Any preferred? I do not mind any of the headsets, though I would want to work with something better than the Google cardboard)

Controllers with movement tracking with them, use them as arms? (Professor said most like the Razer Hydra controllers will be available to us).
I think if we do use controllers we should also make head tracking available where the button on the side would act as the grab button and the crosshairs would be in the center of where you are looking. Only downside is that you can’t move. Maybe we do this first and if we feel we have time for the controllers and it wouldn’t be too difficult we can go ahead and implement those too. Then we could make it an option on the menu of whether you want to use controllers or not. We could use Gear VR, I think we would have access to one. 
Yeah that makes sense. Let’s do the headtracking crosshair first with the grab button. It seems easier too. If we have extra time, we can use controllers.

Camera Movement (left right up down) with Controller? (Like left controller stick input can move camera around, while right controller can be arm that can control objects?)

Crosshair with headset or controllers (You point with controller to an object to manipulate or look at something to manipulate it)

Shooting Ability with button input on controller? (Launches object forward at high velocity)

#### Environment:
Lighting:
Ceiling Lights, Plain White Color
Maybe Red Dim Lights on Walls in Pattern

Inside Box Room 
Textured Walls and Floors - going off by theme

Objects Floating Around: Start with gravity, click button 
List Of Random Objects We Can Put In: 
Bowling Ball
Lamp
Chairs
Table
Tire
Shoes
Pictures
Fruits/Food (Apple, Banana, Oranges)
(Add anything else you can think of)
Manakin

Zero-gravity objects, originally follows animated path until manipulated?

Do we want to go into depth working with the object’s material? (I suck with material work, only know basics like shineness/roughness)
		Yeah I am really bad at materials too. We should import materials or not worry about them at the moment.

When manipulating object (moving, have control), have particle effect on object?       (a glow to the object)
    
    
#### Sounds:
Background Music: Goes with whatever theme is, simple background music.

Sound Effects: 
Grabbing objects 
Objects hitting walls 

#### Goal:

The main goal of this project is to properly implement working VR aspects into a program.

The next stage is to use these VR aspects to create something with it, we will split off into two ideas: 

Game:
Catching game: Objects being thrown at you, do not let it touch ground until caught.
Building game: Build structures with the given objects, more of a interaction game.
Throwing objects at targets for points.

Networking?:
Add another headset user through another computer/iphone with internet/wifi networking. I think it would be awesome but I believe it would be a lot of work. (I done through this a unity project with a youtube tutorial, but it was a long time ago and was limited.)

If we do get networking successfully, we can think of many new ideas like two people working together to get out of this dome. Or two people working together in two different rooms.

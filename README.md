# Telekinesis-Project
Unity Google Cardboard VR Application

A classmate and I decided to work on creating a virtualy reality application for androids and iphones. I will be posting my Javascript here that I create, along with a short screenshot video to demonstrate the script in Unity. Our goal is to create many simple scripts with the Google Cardboard magnet input we are given. We will be using the prefabs CardboardMain for headset motion tracking and CardboardReticle for crosshairs/gameObject selection.

## Project Layout


#### Software Using: 
Unity3D 5.3.1, 3D Modeling Program (Blender, 3ds max, etc)

#### Title of Project: 
Nutmeg (Working Title) ||
Telekinesis something maybe?

#### Theme of Room:
Dome/Outdoors Area 

#### Controls / Inputs:
	
Google Cardboard: Manipulating objects with button on headset.

Headset Movement: Hold down move with button or point and travel style?

Controller Movement With Razer Hydra (left right up down)? (Like left controller stick input can move camera around, while right controller can be arm that can control objects?)	*Edit* Motion Tracking Not Perfect With Razer Hydra. Probably will stick with just headset.

Crosshair with headset or controllers (You point with controller to an object to manipulate or look at something to manipulate it)

Shooting Ability with button input on controller or headset? (Launches object forward at high velocity)

#### Environment:

Lighting (If Inside): Ceiling Lights, Plain White Color. Maybe Red Dim Lights on Walls in Pattern.
-
Textured Walls and Floors - going off by theme
-
Objects Floating Around: Start with gravity, Click button 
-
List Of Random Objects We Can Put In: 
	Bowling Ball,
	Lamp,
	Chairs,
	Table,
	Tire,
	Shoes,
	Pictures,
	Fruits/Food (Apple, Banana, Oranges),
	(Add anything else you can think of),
	Manakin.
-
Zero-gravity objects, originally follows animated path until manipulated?
-
When manipulating object (moving, have control), have particle effect on object? (a glow to the object)
    
    
#### Sounds:

Background Music: Goes with whatever theme is, simple background music, different music for different situations.
-
Sound Effects: Grabbing objects, Objects hitting walls.
-

#### Goal:
The main goal of this project is to properly implement working VR aspects into a program.
-
The next stage is to use these VR aspects to create something with it, we will split off into two ideas: 
-
####Game:
-
Catching game: Objects being thrown at you, do not let it touch ground until caught.
-
Building game: Build structures with the given objects, more of a interaction game.
-
Throwing objects at targets for points.
-
-
Networking?:
-
Add another headset user through another computer/iphone with internet/wifi networking. I think it would be awesome but I believe it would be a lot of work. (I done through this a unity project with a youtube tutorial, but it was a long time ago and was limited.)
-
If we do get networking successfully, we can think of many new ideas like two people working together to get out of this dome. Or two people working together in two different rooms.

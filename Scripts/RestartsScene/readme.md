Fourth Script Made:

Function: Restarts Current Scene

This Script Is Actually Very Wrong. But It Reloads Current Scene Which Is What I Wanted It To Do. Probably has something to do with the SceneManager Variable. It is NULL now that I realize it. Look at B6SendToPlanets.cs script if you want to learn to load other scenes properly.

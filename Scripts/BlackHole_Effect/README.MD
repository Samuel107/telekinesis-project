Summary Of All Scripts:

These scripts are to best create a black hole effect on a gameObject. It will grab all moveable objects and move it towards a object.
Once the object collides with the black hole, it will freeze that moveable object cords wherever it hit the collider.  
(I really shouldn't call this a black hole, since it doesn't destroy the game object, but it sounds cooler)

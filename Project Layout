## Project Layout


#### Software Using: 
Unity3D 5.3.1, 3D Modeling Program (Blender, 3ds max, etc)

#### Title of Project: 
Nutmeg (Working Title) ||
Telekinesis something.

#### Theme of Room:
Simple Dome Room or Outdoors Area.

#### Controls / Inputs:
	
Google Cardboard: Manipulating objects with button on headset.

Headset Movement: Hold down move with button or point and travel style?

Controller Movement With Razer Hydra (left right up down)? (Like left controller stick input can move camera around, while right controller can be arm that can control objects?)	** Motion Tracking Not Perfect With Razer Hydra. Probably will stick with just headset.

Crosshair with headset or controllers (You point with controller to an object to manipulate or look at something to manipulate it)

Shooting Ability with button input on controller or headset? (Launches object forward at high velocity)

#### Environment:

Lighting (If Inside): Ceiling Lights, Plain White Color. Maybe Red Dim Lights on Walls in Pattern.

Textured Walls and Floors - going off by theme

Objects Floating Around: Start with gravity, Click button 

List Of Random Objects We Can Put In: 
	Bowling Ball,
	Lamp,
	Chairs,
	Table,
	Tire,
	Shoes,
	Pictures,
	Fruits/Food (Apple, Banana, Oranges),
	(Add anything else you can think of),
	Manakin.

Zero-gravity objects, originally follows animated path until manipulated?

When manipulating object (moving, have control), have particle effect on object? (a glow to the object)
    
    
#### Sounds:

Background Music: Goes with whatever theme is, simple background music, different music for different situations.

Sound Effects: Grabbing objects, Objects hitting walls.

## Goal:

The main goal of this project is to properly implement working VR aspects into a program.

The next stage is to use these VR aspects to create a game, which will be another project.

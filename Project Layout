## Project Layout

#### Software Using: 
Unity3D 5.3.1/5.3.3, Blender (For Quick Editting)

#### Title of Project: 
Fabulous Nutmeg (Working Title).

#### Theme of Room:
Outdoor Playground Area.

#### Controls / Inputs:
	
Google Cardboard: Manipulating objects with single button click on headset.

Headset Movement: Two quick button clicks

Crosshair with headset: wherever you look, crosshair follows with center of headset camera

Shooting Ability with button input: Launches object forward at high velocity

###### Future Ideas:

Controller Movement With Razer Hydra? (Like left controller stick input can move camera around, while right controller can be arm that can control objects?)	**Ask a fellow colleague about it. Motion tracking with Razor Hydra isn't completely accurate he said, which is important with precisely manipulating game objects. Probably will stick with just headset.

If access to tracking controller movement for arms, have crosshair (raycaster) be put on controllers. So now you must point your controller to manipulate GameObjects.

#### Environment:

Lighting: Sun, maybe street lamps later in project.

Textured Walls and Floors: Grass, woodchips, brick walls (Going off playground theme).

Objects Floating Around: Gravity On/Off Switch for GameObjects that can be manipulated.

List Of Random Objects To Be Put In (All of these will be from free Unity asset store): 
	Whale,
	Bowling Ball,
	Lamp,
	Chairs,
	Table,
	Tire,
	Shoes,
	Pictures,
	Fruits/Food (Apple, Banana, Oranges),
	(Add anything else you can think of),
	Manakin.

When manipulating object (moving, have control), have particle effect or glow on object
    
    
#### Sounds:

Background Music: Goes with whatever theme is, simple background music, different music for different situations.

Sound Effects: Grabbing objects, Objects hitting walls.

## Goal:

The main goal of this project is to properly implement working VR aspects into a program.

The next stage is to use these VR aspects to create something. This will be another project in the future.

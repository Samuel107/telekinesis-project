## Project Layout

#### Software Using: 
Unity 5.3.3f1, Blender3D Modeling (For Quick Editting)

#### Title of Project: 
Fabulous Nutmeg (Working Title).

#### Theme of Room:
Outdoor Playground Area.

#### Controls / Inputs:
	
Google Cardboard Magnet: Lets You Interact With The World In Different Ways
	
	1a) Pick Up: Hover Crosshair Over Object, Trigger Cardboard Magnet To Pick Up
	1b) Throw: Once Object Is Picked Up, Trigger Again To Throw
	2) Movement: Walk Around At A Slow Pace With Two Quick Trigger Pulls, Look In Different Directions To Walk That Way

InGame Control Panel: Allows More Possibilities, Use Cardboard Magnet Click While Looking At One Of The Buttons

	1) Button 1 - Activate Game Objects In Scene
	2) Button 2 - Bomb Minigame (My classmate made this, so I will not show code or video of it)
	3) Button 3 - Zero Gravity To Moveable Objects
	4) Button 4 - Reset Scene (It gets messy pretty quick)
	5) Button 5 - Gives Ability To Shoot Bullet (This turns off pick up and throw and movement abilities)
	6) Button 6 - Changes Scene
	7) Button 7 - Spawns Black Hole (All moveable items pulls to it)

###### Other Ideas:

Controller Movement With Razer Hydra? (Like left controller stick input can move camera around, while right controller can be arm that can control objects?)	**Ask a fellow classmate about it. Motion tracking with Razor Hydra isn't completely accurate when he tried (first time he used them though). Probably will stick with just headset in this project.

If access to tracking controller movement for arms, have crosshair (raycaster) be put on one of the controller. Now you must point your controller to manipulate GameObjects.

#### Environment:

Lighting: Sun

Textured Walls and Floors: Grass, Woodchips, Brick Walls (Going off playground theme).

Objects Floating Around: Gravity On/Off Switch for GameObjects That Can Be Manipulated.

List Of Random Objects To Be Put In (Only using free imports from Unity asset store): 
	Whale,
	Bowling Ball,
	Lamp,
	Chairs,
	Table,
	Tire,
	Shoes,
	Pictures,
	Fruits/Food (Apple, Banana, Oranges),
	Manakin,
	etc etc.

When Manipulating Object (Moving, Have Control), Have Particle Effect or Glow On Object.
    
    
#### Sounds:

Background Music: Simple music, though change in music for different situations.

Sound Effects: Grabbing Objects, Object Collisions.
